# graphene-edges-code
To comprehend the topological phases in graphene, it's essential to consider the electronic structure of its edges. We have developed a straightforward tight-binding Hamiltonian code for both armchair and zigzag edges of graphene. Using this code, you can explore the topological phases in graphene as described in the Kane-Mele model for the Quantum Spin Hall effect (Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 146802, 2005). This code was created by Chandan K. Singh and Surjit Sarkar.
